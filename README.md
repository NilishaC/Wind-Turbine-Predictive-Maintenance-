# Wind-Turbine-Predictive-Maintenance-
Wind patterns across the globe vary over the year and can be unpredictable at times, with this variability in the wind leading to fluctuating loads on wind turbine components. A typical wind turbine consists of more than a dozen bearings that are expected to work simultaneously and continuously for many years. As a result, wind turbine bearings and gearboxes are often susceptible to failure well before their designed service lives. Bearing failures in wind turbines are a significant cause of downtime in energy production for unplanned maintenance, repairs and replacements. This failure resulted in a significant increase in operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for the wind energy operator and in higher utility bills for the customer. The National Renewable Energy Laboratoryâ€™s (NREL) Gearbox Reliability Database (GRD) shows that 76% of gearboxes failed due to bearings, while 17% failed due to gear failures. This shows the importance of reliable bearings and gearboxes for wind turbine operations to the economy and society.
